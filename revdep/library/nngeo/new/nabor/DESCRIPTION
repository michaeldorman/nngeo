Title: Wraps 'libnabo', a Fast K Nearest Neighbour Library for Low
        Dimensions
Version: 0.5.0
Author: Stephane Mangenat (for 'libnabo'), Gregory Jefferis
Maintainer: Gregory Jefferis <jefferis@gmail.com>
Description: An R wrapper for 'libnabo', an exact or approximate k nearest
    neighbour library which is optimised for low dimensional spaces (e.g. 3D).
    'libnabo' has speed and space advantages over the 'ANN' library wrapped by
    package 'RANN'. 'nabor' includes a knn function that is designed as a 
    drop-in replacement for 'RANN' function nn2. In addition, objects which 
    include the k-d tree search structure can be returned to speed up repeated 
    queries of the same set of target points.
